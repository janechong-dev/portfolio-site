### Workflow

- Start with requirements analysis
    - using Claude to debate about design and approach
    - ~25% of project time, human led
- Break into small tasks and use TDD loop
    - plan → write tests → pass tests 
    - ~50% of project time, AI led
- Finish with functional testing to ensure requirements are met
    - ~25% of project time, human led


### Tool of Choice & Techniques

- Cursor IDE: for inline edits
- Claude Code: for agentic coding 
    - Claude.md: add requirements, decisions, style guide
    - Plan mode: with "think hard" for more complex decisions
    - Expert agents: for code review and design critique

## Challenges & Solutions

- To avoid going over context window
    - break into self contained tasks, /clear Claude and regurgitate task req
- To avoid untrackable edits
    - disallow edit/bash permissions, review before accepting, use git
- To avoid over engineering
    - use TDD and "implement minimum needed to pass tests"


## My philosophy

- Must understand requirements clearly before AI can help
- Measure twice, cut once - spend more time on planning phase
- Merely a pair programmer, need to know best practices to be able to guide
