Used vercel's [portfolio starter kit](https://vercel.com/templates/next.js/portfolio-starter-kit) to build this site, it's looking really sleek, auto deploys, took half an hour to set up including getting this domain. Gonna use this to document the new tools and projects i'll be trying out, each post gets me green on github streak too haha.
